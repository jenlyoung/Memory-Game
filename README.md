# Memory Game Project

Welcome to my matching game! This game was designed as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. Enjoy!

## How to Play

There are 16 cards on a board and 8 matching pairs.  Click on the cards to reveal icons and see if you got a match!

If the cards match, they will remain open.  If they do not match, they will flip over and you can try again.

Once you get all 8 matches, the game is over and you will receive a star rating based on how well you did.
